Module 8

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This project was to design an app that would help the user track their weight over time. The app required a SQLite database for login information and for logging the weight data. The app was meant to help the user track their daily weight until they met their end goal weight.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The app had a home page, a goal weight screen, and a past weight screen. I designed the app with clickable buttons that were far enough apart to avoid misclicks. I used color options that intuitively guide the user to the correct option.   

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I created a wireframe of the app, and coded the app to match. When I would debug or sompile, I would notice things that needed to be added for the app to be successful. I used SHA256 encryption on the passwords for security as an afterthought.   

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I would compile and see what errors and feedback game from Android Studio. I sent the app to 2 of my friends and sought their feedback as beta testers. Android Studio reminded me not to hard code strings, and my friends told me top change the button colors.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I wanted to create something that was fully functional and ready to be deployed, so I tried to make it as professional and complete as possible.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
Using encryption for passwords demonstrated secure coding techniques and skill.
